His use of a profanity to describe all British employers, if done my any other minister would have resulted in immediate dismissal - so why hasn't Maysy sacked him - perhaps she shares his opinion that all British workers should lose their employment - LIKE BORIS.

May's Tory party is a dead man walking - with no standards or integrity.

Kick out Boris.`,
